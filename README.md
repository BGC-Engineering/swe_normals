# Introduction 
BGCers rely on many data sets from many providers to do their work.  In many cases, the data are difficult to access.  This project abstracts many of the complications by providing a common and simple API to access data from many sources.

# Getting Started

## Installation process

To install the package locally:

Then, install the package with the following command:

```bash
conda create -n swe-normals python=3.11.5
conda activate swe-normals
pip install swe-normals
```

## Secrets
Accessing Snodas and Copernicus data, requires credentials.  The recommended way to store this information is in a file called `.env`.  Keep this file in the same directory as the one in which you are working from, for example, `C:\\Documents\my_data_pull`.

The file should have the following lines:

```bash
SNODAS_SAS=""
COPERNICUS_SAS=""
```

The `CLIMATEDATA_SAS` will contain a long string beginning with a "`?`" that is generated by the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer. The current .env file shared has a SAS that will expire September 2026, reach out to a data science team member for a new SAS once it expires
